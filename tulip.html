        <h1>Tulip</h1>

        <p>Tulips are <a href="plant.html">plants</a></p>

        <p>Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in the Tulipa genus. Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[2] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.</p>

        <p>The plant has an erect rough-hairy stem, reaching typical heights of 3 metres (10 feet). The tallest sunflower on record achieved 10.9 m (35 ft 9 in).[3] Sunflower leaves are broad, coarsely toothed, rough and mostly alternate; those near the bottom are largest and commonly heart-shaped.[4]</p>
