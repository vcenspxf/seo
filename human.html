        <h1>Human</h1>

        <p>Humans are <a href="anima.html">animals</a></p>

        <p>Humans (Homo sapiens, meaning "thinking man" or "wise man") are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the only extant species of the genus Homo. They are great apes characterized by hairlessness, obligate bipedality, manual dexterity with opposable thumbs, precision grip, and high intelligence.[1] Humans have large brains compared to body size (a high encephalization quotient), enabling more advanced cognitive skills that facilitate successful adaptation to varied environments, development of sophisticated tools, and formation of complex social structures and civilizations.[2] Humans possess a disproportionately larger volume of both cerebral white matter and gray matter present in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) than any other primate species, which facilitated the expansion of higher-order executive functions.[3][4]</p>

        <p>Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of distinct social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society.</p>
